c. Use fdisk to create more than 4 primary partitions, or more than 2 extended partitions.
d. Use fdisk to create the following partitions using the complete disk without gaps:
    + 1 P (FAT32 (LBA)), 1 E, 1 P (Linux)
    + 2 L (Linux swap, Linux)
e. Display the disk partitions using p in normal mode of "fdisk disk".
